# Executive Summary

The global economic and policy landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from the limitations of the Washington Consensus toward a new framework—the London Consensus—that prioritizes social factors, institutional resilience, and national happiness as core measures of success [1, 2, 3, 6].

Technological disruption is accelerating this change. The rapid adoption of AI and advanced computing is driving intense global competition for technological leadership [1]. This innovation underpins the exponential growth of Industry 5.0, a market valued at over $51.5 billion in 2023, which emphasizes human-centric, sustainable, and resilient industrial production. Policymakers must recognize the projected $29 trillion to $48 trillion revenue potential of emerging industry arenas by 2040 [2].

Simultaneously, geopolitical uncertainty poses significant risks, particularly within the global energy system, despite the ongoing transition driven by clean technologies like solar and wind [19, 20, 21, 22]. Addressing these fragilities requires massive capital deployment; an estimated $106 trillion in cumulative investment is needed through 2040 for global infrastructure alone [3]. Decision-makers must align strategic planning with the urgent climate imperative identified by the IPCC [4], focusing on transformative, equitable action while navigating internal policy divides and adapting investment strategies to manage geopolitical volatility and capitalize on AI-driven private markets.

# Market Landscape

The global technology market landscape is defined by rapid innovation, intense geopolitical competition, and a strategic shift toward efficiency-driven digital transformation [3, 4, 14]. Following macroeconomic challenges in 2022 and 2023, the sector is poised for robust growth, driven by enterprise investment in automation and strategic technologies [16, 4, 20].

# Risks & Open Questions

## Knowledge Gaps and Unforeseen Threats

*   **Unknown Unknowns:** Risks that are unforeseen and unanticipated because they fall outside the realm of current knowledge or past experience, often arising from complex interdependencies [16]. These are particularly dangerous in cybersecurity, where assets are unknown and thus impossible to secure [17].
*   **Internal Blind Spots:** The most significant risks often stem from knowledge gaps that organizations are unaware they possess. Many so-called unknown unknowns were actually knowable if key information held by project personnel had been communicated to top decision-makers [18].
*   **Data Analysis Failure:** Most companies analyze only 12% of collected data, leaving 88% of competitive threats and opportunities unnoticed, which can lead to significant losses and competitive blind spots [19].
*   **Competitive Displacement:** Established firms risk being displaced by smaller rivals due to internal routinism, outdated R&D opinions, and limited perception focused only on themselves, failing to conduct fact-based assessments of competitor threats [23, 24].

## Regulatory and Legal Friction

*   **Challenged Regulatory Authority:** The Supreme Court's decision to overrule the *Chevron* deference framework opens the door to new legal challenges against federal regulations, potentially having enduring effects on agencies' ability to implement policies [20].
*   **Outdated Frameworks:** Developments in regenerative medicine creating 'hybrid therapies' (combining medicines, devices, and human cells) pose significant challenges to regulatory frameworks that traditionally regulated these components separately [21].
*   **Global Hurdles:** Global regulatory hurdles for medical devices pose risks to innovation and market access [22]. Furthermore, regulatory challenges have been cited as the primary reason why certain payment innovation initiatives, such as Open Banking, have not fully met expectations [23].
*   **Unregulated Services:** The traditional regulatory system for the legal profession is ineffective at fostering necessary collaboration with nonlaw professionals, especially as nonlawyers provide services online without regulation [24].
*   **Regulatory Costs:** Optimal regulatory rule-making is complicated by the fact that firms can challenge regulations in court, forcing regulators to incur costs to preclude challenges or accept legal fees [25].

## Technological Scaling and Systemic Failure

*   **AI Compute Bottlenecks:** Scaling computational resources for AI model training faces limitations over the next decade due to bottlenecks in the complex, internationally distributed supply chain for semiconductors [26]. Constraints in human capital and power are projected to limit cumulative AI chip manufacturing capacity, potentially reducing the likelihood of some near-term transformative AI scenarios [26].
*   **Agentic Failure Modes:** Agentic AI systems are subject to various failure modes, including specific threats like a 'Memory poisoning attack' on an AI email assistant, which require analysis of their effects and potential mitigations [27].
*   **Inevitable Failure:** Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) is based on the key tenet that failures are inevitable, even with multiple layers of resiliency, particularly in complex environments [28].

## Ethical and Unintended Consequences

*   **Systemic Intervention Risks:** Interventions like Nature-based Solutions (NbS) carry systemic risks, including ecological side effects, socio-political inequities, and epistemological overconfidence, challenging the assumption that such interventions are inherently beneficial [29].
*   **Sustainable Development Backlash:** Sustainable development initiatives often lead to unintended consequences within social-ecological systems, such as those related to conservation efforts or alternative livelihood programs [30].
*   **Regulatory Side Effects:** Measures intended to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) can result in unintended consequences, including derisking, financial exclusion, and the suppression of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and human rights [31].
*   **AI Ethical Challenges:** Emerging technologies, especially AI, are not ethically neutral [32]. Ethical risks associated with Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) are categorized across technology (e.g., algorithmic bias, privacy invasion), education (e.g., homogenized development), and society (e.g., digital divide, lack of accountability) [33].
*   **Dynamic Ethical Factors:** Business leaders must be aware of dynamic ethical risk factors, which are often driven by global geopolitical and economic events (e.g., inflation, cost of living crises) that pose reputational, operational, and financial risks [34].

# Outlook (12–24 months)

The 12-to-24-month outlook suggests a period of decelerating US growth, stabilizing inflation in developed markets, continued geopolitical complexity, and accelerated technological competition in key sectors.

### 1. US Monetary Easing and Decelerated Growth (2025–2026)

The US economy is forecasted to experience decelerated growth, with real GDP projected at 0.9% in 2025, maintaining a 30% to 50% probability of recession [35]. This environment will prompt the Federal Reserve to implement further rate cuts. The median forecast projects the federal funds target range to reach 3.926% by the end of 2025 and 3.625% by the end of 2026 [2, 21]. Core PCE inflation is expected to end 2025 at 3.1% year-over-year [35].

*   **Leading Indicators to Track:** Real GDP growth figures, Core PCE inflation rate, FOMC dot plot updates, and the unemployment rate (expected to stabilize around 4.4% in 2026) [2, 20].

### 2. European Economic Recovery and Inflation Stabilization (2025–2026)

The Euro area economy is expected to strengthen, with real GDP growth accelerating to 1.2% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026 [36]. This recovery is anticipated to pull the Austrian economy out of its post-WWII recession by mid-2025 [37]. Headline HICP inflation in the Euro area is expected to decline and stabilize near 1.9% throughout both 2025 and 2026 [36].

*   **Leading Indicators to Track:** Euro area HICP inflation, Euro area real GDP growth, and unemployment rates (expected to average 6.5% in 2025) [36].

### 3. Equity Market Highs and Dollar Weakness (2025)

US equity markets are projected to continue their upward trajectory, with the S&P 500 expected to close near 6,000 by year-end 2025, supported by double-digit earnings growth [38]. Concurrently, the US Dollar is expected to weaken against Emerging Market (EM) currencies as US economic exceptionalism fades [38]. Ongoing trade policy shifts are anticipated to cause a broad-based downshift in global growth while shifting inflation pressures toward the U.S. [38].

*   **Leading Indicators to Track:** S&P 500 earnings growth reports, DXY index performance, and EM currency performance [38].

### 4. Intensified Geopolitical and Regulatory Complexity (2025–2026)

Overall uncertainty, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical disruptions, is expected to continue or deepen through 2026 [6, 3]. Geopolitical complexity will be heightened by the global elections supercycle and new areas of competition, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the oceans [39]. Businesses must navigate diverging AI policies and potential sweeping US tariff proposals, which risk raising CPI inflation by over 1 percentage point [15, 17]. Strategic realignment and supply chain adjustments will be necessary to manage compliance risks and reliance on critical mineral supply chains [15, 17].

*   **Leading Indicators to Track:** Implementation status of new US tariff proposals, regulatory divergence indices concerning AI, and critical mineral supply chain stability metrics [15, 17].

### 5. Accelerated Growth in Next-Generation Biotherapeutics (2025–2026)

The Global Biotechnology Market, valued at $1.8 trillion in 2024, is expected to sustain strong growth (13.543% CAGR through 2034) [40]. The Next Generation Biotherapeutics segment, specifically, is projected to grow at a 12.05% CAGR (2026–2030), fueled by technological advancements in platforms like CRISPR gene editing, mRNA delivery, and synthetic biology [41]. Global regulatory bodies are expected to continue expediting market access for these innovative treatments, shortening time-to-market [41].

*   **Leading Indicators to Track:** Number of new Breakthrough Therapy Designations granted by regulatory bodies, R&D investment in synthetic biology platforms, and revenue growth of key biotechnology firms [41].
