# DSPy Examples with GEPA

A collection of practical examples demonstrating how to use [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/).

## About

This repository contains various examples showcasing different applications of DSPy (+ GEPA optimizer).

### What is DSPy?

DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing language model prompts and weights. Instead of manually tweaking prompts, you define what your system should do (the signature), and DSPy figures out how to do it through optimization.

### What is GEPA?

GEPA (Generalized Evolution of Prompting via Adaptation) is a DSPy optimizer that:
- Automatically improves prompts through iterative reflection
- Learns from feedback metrics without requiring labeled data
- Evolves instructions based on performance analysis
- Enables zero-shot learning with just input/output pairs

## Examples

### 1. [PII De-identification](./dspy-gepa-deidentification/)

Demonstrates using GEPA to automatically optimize prompts for redacting personally identifiable information (PII) from incident reports.

**Key concepts:**
- Automatic prompt optimization for sensitive data handling
- Dual metric systems (simple and composite)
- Structured output preservation
- Feedback-driven learning

## Getting Started

Each example directory contains its own README with:
- Detailed setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration details
- Code explanations

Navigate to any example directory to get started.

## Requirements

Most examples require:
- Python 3.13+
- An OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM provider)
- Dependencies managed via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or pip

## Contributing

Additional examples are welcome! If you have a useful DSPy (+ GEPA) example to share:
1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a comprehensive README.md
3. Ensure dependencies are clearly documented
4. Add your example to this README's Examples section
5. Submit a pull request
